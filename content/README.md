Целью этого документа является введение вас в мир ReactJS и Webpack. Оба они являются мощными технологиями и когда они используются вместе, front-end разработка начинает приносить удовольствие.

Книга рецептов должна быть полезной разработчику с любым уровнем квалификации. Если вас интересует только ReactJS, пропускайте часть с Webpack и наоборот. A more tutorial oriented approach is available in the form of [SurviveJS - Webpack and React](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react) book.

## React

React is a library that greatly simplifies component development. Once you understand its basics, you can build your own stack around it. This is in contrast to frameworks, such as Angular, that try to offer everything and a kitchen sink.

[The official tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) is a good starting point if you just want a quick look at the technology.

Perhaps the most intriguing thing about React is that it keeps on challenging traditional web development. It allows us to rethink concepts such as separation of concern. It will also influence on mobile development in the form of [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native). React Native allow native level performance while making it possible to develop apps in a tight realtime preview loop using JavaScript.

## Webpack

Webpack operates on a lower level. It is a module bundler. In essence it is something that you use to build your project into deliverable components (HTML, CSS, JS). The nice thing about Webpack is that once you initially configure it, it deals with the nasty details for you. This allows you to mix various technologies within your project without a headache.

If you are completely new to Webpack and want to go through a good introduction, check out [Pete Hunt's guide](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto). You'll find the basics there. This guide merely complements his.
